For many years, I've been thinking about starting a blog.

There were always good reasons to do it: new technologies constantly emerging, lessons learned in my day-to-day work, architectural decisions that went well - and others that didn't. Experiments with new tools. Side projects. Successes. Failures.

Plenty of material.

But at the same time, there were just as many reasons not to start:

- Not enough time.
- Family and hobbies.
- The feeling that I might not have anything interesting to say.
- Or worse - that no one would read it anyway.

So I postponed it. For years.

Recently, I rewrote [echooff.dev](/) using [Astro](https://astro.build). What started as a technical rewrite slowly turned into something else. While polishing the setup, tweaking performance, and cleaning up the structure, I realized:

If not now, when?

I don’t see this blog as a platform for polished thought leadership. I see it as a space to think in public. A place to reflect on my work as a professional software engineer - especially the everyday parts of the job that often stay invisible.

As an experienced Software Engineer, a big part of my job isn't just writing code. It's navigating trade-offs, making decisions with incomplete information, mentoring others, revisiting past decisions, and occasionally admitting I was wrong.

That's the kind of stuff I want to write about.

I also want to document side projects, technical experiments, and the small lessons learned along the way. Not because they are revolutionary - but because they are real.

And maybe that's enough.

This blog is an experiment. But it's also a commitment:

- to think more deeply about my work
- to improve my writing
- and to share what I learn along the way

Writing is a skill that improves with practice.

So this is me practicing.

See you soon 👋
